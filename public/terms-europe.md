### **Further Information**

#### **Data Transfer to the USA and the Data Privacy Framework**

We would like to point out that on July 10, 2023, the EU Commission adopted an adequacy decision on the **EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF)** pursuant to Art. 45 Para. 1 GDPR. Accordingly, organizations or companies (as data importers) in the USA that are registered on a public list as part of the self-certification of the Data Privacy Framework offer an adequate level of protection for data transfers. This therefore represents a valid legal basis for using certified US services. For all purposes mentioned in this privacy notice that use services from US providers with an adequate level of protection, **"Data Privacy Framework"** is noted in the legal basis. You can check whether a service provider is certified directly on the **Data Privacy Framework website**.

If a provider is not certified by the Data Privacy Framework, this is explicitly mentioned for the respective purpose, and a valid alternative legal basis is cited.

#### **Standard Contractual Clauses**

To enable data transfer to countries without an adequacy decision, the EU Commission has created contract templates (**Standard Contractual Clauses**). These Standard Contractual Clauses obligate contracting parties to maintain a level of data protection comparable to that in the EU. These contract texts are available on the **European Union website**. Standard Contractual Clauses are also abbreviated as **"SCCs."**

#### **Cookies and Local Storage**

This website stores personal data and information in **cookies, in session storage, and in local storage**. The processing is carried out on the legal basis specified for the respective service.

You can set how your web browser handles cookies and local storage, which storage processes are permitted or rejected, and for how long the data is processed in your web browser settings.

#### **Storage Duration**

We store your personal data only as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes mentioned above or as required by contractual or legal retention periods.

#### **Data Disclosure**

We only disclose your personal data to third parties if required by law, if it is necessary to provide our services, or if you have given your consent to the disclosure. We will never sell your data to third parties without your explicit consent.

Data may be disclosed, where necessary, to the following categories of recipients:

- Processors mentioned in this privacy policy
- Banks and payment service providers (payment processing)
- Shipping service providers (shipping of goods and invoices)
- Tax advisors (accounting and annual financial statements)
- Collection agencies (debt collection)
- Lawyers (enforcement of legal claims)

#### **Protection of Personal Data**

We protect personal data using appropriate **technical and organizational measures** that comply with current industry practices. Where possible, this includes, in particular, pseudonymization and encryption of personal data during transmission and storage.

#### **Withdrawal of Given Consent**

If you have given consent for the processing of your personal data for a specific purpose based on **Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR**, you can **withdraw this consent at any time**. The lawfulness of the processing of personal data until the withdrawal is not affected by the withdrawal.

#### **Mandatory Data Provision and Consequences of Non-Provision When Visiting the Website**

The provision of personal data for visiting our website is not required by law or contract. Non-provision of your personal data is possible if you do not visit this website. For certain functions on our website, non-provision of data means that these functions cannot be used.
