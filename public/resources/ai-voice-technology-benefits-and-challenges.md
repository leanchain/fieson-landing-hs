# AI Voice

AI-generated voice technology continues to find new applications and new ways to baffle. With the ability to produce any voice in any language, accent, and tone, from whispers to shouts and everything in between – it is now almost impossible to distinguish AI voices from human ones. Businesses across the board are benefiting from this, as even unskilled employees can program and customize these voices. The key for companies is to work with an AI voice generator platform that provides an intuitive interface and simple input methods while enabling output usage across a number of media. 

## What Is AI Voice?

AI voice technology allows computers to generate ultra-realistic human-like speech by using artificial intelligence. We are all familiar with the synthetic voices that accompany, for example, YouTube videos. This technology allows creators to scale up video production without needing a human narrator. However, recent advances have expanded this concept into a number of new areas.

## Use Cases of AI Voice Technology

Let’s look at how AI voice generation is being used today, with two application areas in mind:

### Static Audio

This is the “traditional” area of AI voice. It’s typically applied to areas where the input and output are limited, i.e., the user can only input certain prompts, and the output has a set number of responses. This includes narration for videos, where the input is text (the “database”); for programming, the creator uploads a text document containing a set number of responses to user prompts. Static audio also involves the use of a standardized voice type and converts AI voice text to speech. This level of technology is common for things like: 

* Voice-response customer service
* Content creation
* Gaming
* Accessibility tools

### Interactive Multimedia

In contrast to static audio are interactive multimedia applications of AI voice generation. They represent a more advanced type of platform and can handle a greater range of use cases. For example, interactive multimedia AI generation technology includes:

* The ability to create combined video and audio productions where, after setup, only text is needed to control the actions of the video’s [digital human](https://www.d-id.com/resources/glossary/digital-humans/) actor/narrator
* Applications where [Generative Agents](https://www.d-id.com/resources/glossary/generative-agents/) can “converse” with the user to answer essentially any question that it receives (as opposed to the limited prompts and responses of static audio applications)
* The option to use AI voice cloning [based on the voices of actual people](https://www.d-id.com/blog/listen-to-my-voice/) (often combined with a [personalized avatar](https://www.d-id.com/resources/glossary/personalized-avatars/) that also uses the image and movements of a real person)

Interactive media that leverage AI voice technology include marketing and sales, social media productions, live customer service, and corporate learning and development. They also add the element of interactivity to the use cases mentioned for static audio applications.

## How Does AI Voice Technology Work?

The types of technology used by AI voice generation platforms depend on their level of sophistication. At a minimum, AI generated voice requires a Text to Speech (TTS) module to convert the textual output of the computer to a synthesized voice signal. For more advanced applications, a variety of other technologies might be involved, such as:

* Automatic speech recognition in case input is received in the form of a voice command from the user
* Natural language processing (NLP) when the input and output do not need to follow a fixed format; NLP allows the user to input queries in the form of normal language instead of using a set of terms
* Generative artificial intelligence for applications where the output might have to go beyond the content of the database (for example, when an interactive chatbot needs to access a flight schedule)
* [Conversational artificial intelligence](https://www.d-id.com/resources/glossary/conversational-ai/) for real-time interactivity between the technology and the user

## Key Features and Benefits of AI Voice Technology

Just as advanced AI voice platforms use more complex technologies, so do the benefits of AI voice increase according to sophistication. Whereas the original use of AI voice generation was to automatically convert text to speech, thereby saving the time and money that would otherwise be spent on a person, the newer range of [top-grade platforms](https://www.d-id.com/blog/best-ai-voice-generators/) deliver:

* Improved accessibility in the form of no-code applications that accommodate unskilled users
* Lifelike speech quality, be it artificially generated or based on a real voice
