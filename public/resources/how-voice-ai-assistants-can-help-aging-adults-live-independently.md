 Innovations are constantly transforming our lives, work, and interactions in today’s fast-paced technological world. Voice-activated assistants are game-changing tools that have revolutionized how we do things and access information. These innovative devices are improving convenience and promoting independence for older adults in senior living. At Autumn Leaves, we recognize the transformative potential of voice-activated assistants in senior living communities, and we’re excited to explore how these devices are reshaping the landscape of aging gracefully.

**Accepting Innovation: Voice-Activated Assistants’ Ascent:**  
Voice-activated virtual assistants, like Apple’s Siri, Google Assistant, and Amazon’s Alexa, are already commonplace fixtures in homes all over the world. By using artificial intelligence and natural language processing, these intelligent virtual assistants can comprehend spoken instructions and provide customers with hands-free access to a vast range of information and services.  
Voice-activated assistants are becoming more and more popular in senior living communities as more and more elderly citizens become aware of the many advantages these gadgets provide. Voice-activated assistants enable senior citizens to live more easily and independently by doing anything from scheduling and reminders to controlling smart home appliances and getting entertainment.

**Increasing Convenience: Making Everyday Tasks Simpler:**  
The capacity of voice-activated assistants to ease everyday living for older persons and expedite regular chores is one of its biggest benefits. Residents no longer need to touch a gadget or pick up a pen to check the weather, set medicine reminders, or add things to their grocery lists—all with a single voice command.  
Voice-activated assistants also provide hands-free entertainment alternatives, enabling users to just speak a request to listen to podcasts, audiobooks, or music. The entertainment options available to people are customized based on their interests, whether they are cooking or unwinding in their living room.

**Encouraging Accessibility: Strengthening Self-Sufficiency:**  
Voice-activated assistants are an important companion for elderly persons who have limited mobility or cognitive problems. They encourage better accessibility and independence. Voice commands enable homeowners to manage lighting, thermostats, and other smart home appliances, resulting in a more convenient and liveable space.  
Additionally, voice-activated assistants can behave as virtual friends, offering support and company when required. These clever gadgets provide residents and their loved ones peace of mind by doing anything from responding to queries and facilitating social interaction to reminding them to take their medications and giving emergency support.

**Resolving Security and Privacy Issues:**  
Although there is no denying the advantages of voice-activated assistance in elder living, privacy and security concerns must be taken seriously. At Autumn Leaves, we put our residents’ security and privacy first, and we take preventative steps to protect their data.  
Privacy features included in voice-activated assistants let users manage what information is gathered and how it is used. Our employees also go through extensive training to make sure they are aware of the proper procedures for handling and utilizing these devices.

**Embracing the Future of Senior Living:**  
The use of voice-activated assistants is expected to significantly improve older individuals’ convenience, accessibility, and quality of life as we look to the future of senior living. At Autumn Leaves, we’re dedicated to utilizing technology and embracing innovation to build vibrant communities where people may age with grace and completely enjoy life.  
As voice-activated assistants become more common in senior living, we’re giving residents the tools they need to enjoy their freedom, build relationships, and seize the opportunities presented by the digital era. We’re reinventing what it means to age with dignity, meaning, and happiness together.

**Conclusion:**  
To sum up, the introduction of voice-activated assistants into senior housing signifies a radical change in the way we support and care for our elderly. These smart technologies are transforming the way elders live and flourish in our communities by increasing accessibility, empowering independence, and improving convenience.  
At Autumn Leaves, we take great pride in embracing the future of senior living and using technology to make our residents’ lives better. With the support of voice-activated assistants, our elderly residents may age with dignity, assurance, and comfort. One voice command at a time, we’re creating a better future for aging gracefully together.

![Asian senior women working with laptop computer and using smart speakers while setting in living room at home](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201260%20840'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Asian senior women working with laptop computer and using smart speakers while setting in living room at home](https://www.seniorlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Senior-on-computer-with-a-digital-assistant-speaker-1260x840.jpg) 

Digital assistants – also called smart speakers, home assistants or virtual assistants – have exploded in use since being introduced in late 2014 by Amazon. By 2022, 94.9 million smart speakers had been sold, [according to Voicebot](https://voicebot.ai/2022/03/02/the-rise-and-stall-of-the-u-s-smart-speaker-market-new-report/).


About 29% of adults ages 50 and over have adopted digital assistants, [according to AARP](https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/research/surveys_statistics/technology/2021/2021-tech-trends-older-adults.doi.10.26419-2Fres.00420.001.pdf). Their research shows that use of technology like smart speakers is only growing among seniors. This virtual technology, like Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri and Google Assistant, can help seniors with simple tasks and can keep them connected.


Find out about the technology of smart speakers, how they can be helpful to seniors, some of the facts and fallacies about them, and some of the best home assistants for seniors.


## What Is a Smart Speaker?


Smart speakers, or digital assistants, are a combination loudspeaker and voice command device run by Wi-Fi access. They use artificial intelligence software to respond to spoken questions or commands. They can vary from the size of a doughnut to larger than a coffee can.


WIth use of a triggering “hot word” or words, like “Hey Siri,” “Alexa” or “OK Google” (or words you program it to respond to), the device is activated by the user. It then can carry out a number of commands. It can also connect with other “smart” devices in a house.


## 8 Things You Can Do With Digital Assistants


1. Control ‘smart’ devices – If you have a “smart” thermostat, TV or lightbulbs, you can control them through your assistant.
2. Find your phone – Ask your assistant to call your phone if you can’t find it, and your ringer should go off.
3. Get weather forecasts – By adding your ZIP code to your profile, you can ask what the weather is like locally. You can also ask for weather in places where friends and family live, or a travel destination.
4. Hear news reports – You can get news summaries from the source of your choice, such as CNN, Fox, NPR, etc. You can also get local headlines.
5. Listen to audiobooks – If you buy your audiobooks from services like Google Play or Amazon, they can be played from the company’s device.
6. Make shopping lists – Tell your speaker to add something to your list, and it’s taken care of. You can retrieve the list later on your smartphone or smartwatch, or use the list to order online.
7. Play music – Your speaker will play any genre of music you ask it to, or can play from streaming services like Pandora and Spotify.
8. Set timers and reminders – You can set timers for tasks, like turning the stove off to changing a load of laundry. You can put appointments and other events on your calendar. You can also set daily alarms and reminders to take your medications.

## Why Should Seniors Consider Digital Assistants?


As you can see, digital assistants can take care of a lot of your daily routines with minimal help. That can be a big help for older adults with arthritis, hand tremors, impaired vision or limited mobility.


With a personal digital assistant, seniors don’t have to dig through passwords or multiple menus, or find the right app. The assistant can set everything up and knows where notes go. It can set up routines and make sure you’re on schedule.


Digital assistants can also provide companionship to a senior. The speakers have their own “personality” and voice. They can converse with seniors, which encourages connection and offers an alternative to the isolation of having nobody to talk to.


With routines and reminders set a certain way, assistants can greet seniors when they wake up with a weather report, news headlines, reminders of upcoming appointments, a morning affirmation or scriptural verse and a gentle reminder to have breakfast. These reminders can help seniors take care of themselves.


## What Are the Best Virtual Assistants for Seniors?


There are many different brands of digital virtual assistant speakers, from Google to Sonos to Echo to Nest and beyond. Each will offer its own pros and cons, and will connect to different digital assistants. Of course, the speakers work best with their proprietary assistant programs – Amazon Echo with Amazon Alexa, Google Home with Google Assistant, and the like.


Here are the five major digital assistants available.


### 1. Alexa


Alexa is built into Amazon Echo digital speakers and will access your Amazon account. Some third-party speakers, like Sonos, connect to Alexa.


### 2. Bixby


This is the virtual assistant started by Samsung. It is compatible with Samsung smartphones and other Samsung devices.


### 3. Cortana


Microsoft is also in the virtual digital assistant game with Cortana. It’s installed into Windows 10 computers and can be downloaded to Android and Apple devices. Harman Kardon speakers connect with Cortana. Also, since it’s Microsoft, the default search is through Bing, not Chrome.


### 4. Google Assistant


Google Assistant available on the Google Home smart speaker, along with many Android and Google Pixel smartphones. It will connect with your Google accounts, like Gmail. Some third-party speakers connect to Google Assistant.


### 5. Siri


This is probably the most recognized virtual assistant, run by Apple. It works on all Apple products like Apple TV, Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple’s smart speaker, the HomePod.


In the end, the best virtual assistant for seniors may be the one they’re already set up to use.


Consider whether you already have an account with one of the major companies. For example, if you have an iPhone or Apple Watch, you’ll be able to seamlessly connect to an Apple HomePod. If you have an account with Amazon, you’ll be able to work easily with an Amazon Echo.


## Facts and Fallacies About Digital Assistants for Seniors


Some people are concerned about using digital assistants because of misinformation about how they work. Here are some myths and truths about digital assistants.


1. Smart speakers record everything you say – Speakers are designed to listen for their “hot word,” such as “OK Google” or “Alexa,” and they do collect information about how they’re used. If you’re concerned about privacy, you can disable that function in its settings, or just turn the speaker off temporarily.
2. Smart speakers are too complicated – Digital assistants can integrate with smartphones, which can help make them easier to use. Also, the better they are set up, the easier they are to use, so read the instructions carefully when you set it up to make it easier later.
3. Smart speakers can be hacked – True, security breaches can happen, but smart speaker companies are always upgrading their software to protect customers. That said, it is still wise to be selective about what information to share with the assistant, just as you’d be careful what you do with your phone on a public Wi-Fi system – for example, if you have banking or personal health concerns.

Therefore, Voice AI steps ahead in enhancing senior care and promoting their well-being. Don’t believe us? Smart home devices such as voice-activated assistants allow seniors to be in control of their environment, instead of fully relying on their attendants.

These problems often put caregivers under immense pressure. Furthermore, on one hand, when the caregivers are more digitally literate, on the other hand, the seniors with their age-related sensory changes and lack of knowledge, make communication a challenge as they don’t understand what is happening and how to tackle it.

## The Agents of Voice Guardian Solution

In this way, senior people will have someone to look after their health, remind them to take their pills, and enhance their lives.

# Technology that listens: the benefits and challenges of voice assistants for the elderly



 Researchers at the UOC have conducted a review of the risks and potential of using systems such as Alexa or Google Home, which are already present in many homes, to reduce feelings of loneliness  
  

 
 Older people can use voice assistants in their daily lives, as they can play a positive role in their psychological well-being and make a significant contribution to improving their mental health by mitigating feelings of loneliness  
  

 
 The estimated cost of loneliness in Spain amounts to more than €14 billion per year. This problem affects more than three million older people in the country, although it is not exclusive to older people

**Loneliness** has become a very important **social problem** in recent decades. The unwanted emotions it can cause have a direct impact on people's **psychological well-being**, and are related to an increased risk of isolation, a decline in **quality of life**, poorer health, and even increased mortality. This situation is aggravated among **older people**, since they are a social group that is particularly vulnerable to this phenomenon.


A team of researchers at the **Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC)** has conducted a review of studies on the ability of voice assistants to reduce feelings of loneliness among older people. "The primary objective of our work was to examine the evidence on the impact of the use of **voice assistants** on loneliness among older adults. We wanted to find out whether these devices could be an effective tool to address this growing problem in today's society", said **Elena Castro**, a student on the [doctoral programme in Health and Psychology at the UOC](https://www.uoc.edu/en/studies/doctorates/doctorate-health-psychology) and the lead author of this review, which was also authored by professors at the Faculty of Psychology and Education Sciences, **[Modesta Pousada](https://www.uoc.edu/en/news/media-services/experts-guide/modesta-pousada)** and **[Eulàlia Hernández](https://www.uoc.edu/en/news/media-services/experts-guide/eulalia-hernandez)**. All of them are researchers at the [Behavioural Design Lab group at the UOC's eHealth Center](https://blogs.uoc.edu/BDLab/team-behavioural-design-behavior-psychology-researchphd/).


Estimates suggest that there are nearly **three million older people who suffer from loneliness** in some way in Spain alone, according to calculations by the Siempre Acompañados programme undertaken by the "La Caixa" Foundation.


In fact, loneliness is a growing social problem, especially with an ageing population, with consequences that go far beyond social aspects. Recent calculations by the **ONCE Foundation** estimate the cost of loneliness in Spain at more than €14 billion per year, equivalent to 1.17% of Spain's gross domestic product (GDP).






> “Commercial voice assistants in the daily lives of older adults can help mitigate feelings of loneliness”





## Benefits of voice assistants for loneliness


After the review, the experts found that 85% of the studies analysed concluded that the use of devices had made a direct contribution to reducing loneliness.


"The use of commercial voice assistants in **the daily lives** of older people can play a positive role in their psychological well-being, and contribute significantly to improving their mental health by mitigating **feelings of loneliness**," **Castro** explained. Some of the participants in the studies described voice assistants "as a friend or a companion", and referred to them as "a human being". This aspect is essential, as **voice assistants** not only provide a sense of social interaction, but can also provide considerable emotional support, especially for older adults experiencing prolonged isolation.


Even if the interaction is not physical, simply having a 'presence' that responds and assists with everyday tasks can create a **significant emotional connection**, reducing the **perception of loneliness** and fostering a greater sense of well-being. This type of interaction can also mitigate the distress associated with isolation, and improve emotional stability among older people.


This type of technology can therefore help older people feel more connected and less alone. This is another example of how **emerging technologies** are becoming a support to consider in order to facilitate social interaction and enhance how certain tasks are performed. In specific terms, these devices can make **managing everyday life** easier by means of reminders, provide quick and easy access to information and entertainment, and even make the person feel they have support.


"The aim is not to replace human interaction, but instead to offer a solution in situations where these systems can improve people's quality of life", explained the expert. However, **there are still barriers to its implementation**, such as lack of familiarity with technology, resistance to change and mistrust. "This is compounded by the need to tailor the assistants to suit individual needs, and to improve their ability to hold **complex conversations**", she added.


Specific training and skills are therefore required for older people to be able to use this type of device effectively and incorporate it into their daily life.


Around 11% of the Spanish population currently uses **online voice assistants** at some point, according to data provided by the [Spanish Media Research Association (AIMC)](https://www.aimc.es/a1mc-c0nt3nt/uploads/2019/04/190404_NP_EGM_2019ola1.pdf). These figures are rising every year in Spanish homes.


 


## Risks of loneliness


**Loneliness** is a health problem, classified in some cases as a chronic condition, which has major consequences for the quality of life of people who suffer from it, especially in terms of their mental and psychological health.


Loneliness therefore increases the **risk of suffering from and aggravating other illnesses** and pathologies, such as **stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disorders**. It may even make it difficult for patients suffering from other diseases to adhere to their treatment. "The **World Health Organization** now considers loneliness a public health problem, and has highlighted its serious negative impact on older adults' physical and mental health, quality of life and life expectancy. Loneliness is also associated with problems including depression, anxiety and faster cognitive decline", said Castro, stressing the urgent need to address this problem.


Voice assistants offer a **promising solution** to this challenge. The commercial models available to the general public not only help with everyday tasks and issue reminders, but also provide entertainment, quick access to information and enable communication with family and friends. All of these features can help **reduce feelings of loneliness** and improve the quality of life of older people.


**"**Commercially available voice assistants have **significant potential** to help reduce loneliness in older adults, provided they are accompanied by appropriate training and accessibility that enable the use of these technologies to be integrated, adapted to individual needs, and overcome the mistrust that new technologies create among older people in order to **maximize their effectiveness**", concluded the authors.


However, further research is needed to enhance their benefits and analyse their potential risks, as well as the ethical considerations involved in using this type of technology to combat loneliness.
