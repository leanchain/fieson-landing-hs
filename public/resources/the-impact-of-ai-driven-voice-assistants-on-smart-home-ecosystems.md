## Introduction








![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/64b3f94856925214cbfe6639/6e05247e-f51f-457b-91e6-2117eab09470/smart+home+ai.png)





*Home Automation depiction with Advanced AI*









Advanced AI technology is making its way into our homes, transforming ordinary living spaces into smart havens of convenience and efficiency. With that said, we have not yet scratched the surface of how AI will change home automation. In the very near future, we will be laughing on how we struggled with Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri commands. We will no longer be bound by how we frame the question so our commands can be completed. 

*AI-powered devices* are not just about turning lights on or off with a voice command. They adapt to your lifestyle, creating a personalized environment that enhances comfort and security. From adjusting thermostats based on your daily routine to optimizing energy consumption for cost savings, advanced AI technology will revolutionize the way we interact with our living spaces.

*Smart Assistants equipped with AI* will offer an unprecedented level of automation. They will enable our smart homes to be much more efficient than they currently are.

**Advanced AI technology** doesn't just make life easier; it makes it smarter. By integrating seamlessly with various devices, it creates a cohesive ecosystem that works in harmony to improve your quality of life. Whether it's enhancing security through biometric entry systems or providing climate control based on user behavior, the possibilities are endless.

## Real World Examples

The premise of Smart Home IQ is Create Smart Home Automation and Efficiency, not headaches and frustration. Yet so many times, Smart Home Technology can make you so frustrated. This happened to me just last night:

“Alexa, turn off the front door light” - Nothing Happens

“Alexa, turn off the door light” - Nothing Again

“Alexa, turn off the front door light” - Alexa starts talking about creating a routine

“Alexa, Stop!”

“Alexa, turn off the outside front door light” - The light goes out!








![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/64b3f94856925214cbfe6639/2874cbfe-0b87-4b4c-8830-18640d541d3b/AI+Learning+2.png)





*AI Learning*









Because I did not say the command correctly, it did not work. I am looking like a fool arguing with my Echo Dot.

A true AI smart assistant will know and interpret what I meant. I will be able to say “Shut the front door light” and it will interpret what I want it to do. This is where homes will truly become smart.

Here is another example, currently I have an outdoor AOSU camera in my backyard which is connected to Alexa. I can use the command, “Alexa, Show me the backyard” and see the current camera view. What I can’t do is control the camera view in the Alexa app. I can’t zoom, I can’t pan to the left or right, I can only see the current view. This is called Alexa compatible….

To actually control the camera, I have to jump into the AOSU app. An AI Smart Assistant will intuitively understand what I want to do. 

With AI powered Assistants, you say

“Show me the backyard, pan right, zoom in” and it works automatically. It will decipher what you want and make it happen in a much more seamless and less cumbersome way. 

## The Power of AI Driven Voice Assistants

Have you ever used Chat GPT? If you have, I bet you were amazed about what it could do. Now consider that Chat GPT has only been mainstream for about a year. Imagine how much this technology will improve in the near future.

Now instead of cumbersome Alexa commands (or Google or Siri), imagine your home automation platform could offer the same functionality as a Chat GPT. Chat GPT has an intuitiveness to it. It has the ability to fill in the blanks where needed as opposed to an Alexa command that does not work if you do not say the words correctly or clearly. Using the example above, if I said,

“Alexa, Front Door Light, Please Turn Off,” the light would still turn off because the technology can figure out what I mean. The beauty of it will be that each command and action is not one and done. The AI will learn your behavior, your voice and become more efficient over time.

You will be able to have discussions about what you want your smart home to do with your AI Voice Assistant and it will execute on that. You will not need to possess a working knowledge of Information Technology to create automation routines. Who wants to spend hours figuring out how to create a home automation routine that will create 10 minutes of efficiency a week. Not worth the frustration. With AI, we can tell it what we want it to do and it can figure out how to get it accomplished. Works for me!

This will truly make our homes Smart, not just gimmicky smart like most homes using home automation technology today.

## Smart Home Wars - Who Will Deliver the First Fully AI Voice Assistant?

*Virtual AI Assistant of the future*









Given all the advantages of AI driven Home Automation, there will be a major advantage to whoever develops the first fully artificially intelligent smart home platform. We know Amazon is working on an Alexa AI product that will be released later this year. Rumors are that this service will require an extra monthly fee on top of prime. Google owns Bard AI (Chat GPT competitor), so you have to assume they will be developing a product on their own. Apple will not sit idle, though they may lag behind based on their platform prioritizing Privacy and Security first and foremost.

There could be new products launched that change the game. Microsoft has a substantial investment in Chat GPT and could enter the Smart Home Market. Projections for growth of the Smart Home market will make it worth the investment. 

The winner of this race will have a significant advantage in the short term, but for a variety of reasons, which we will explore in a separate post, this should not have any monopolistic effects. In fact, if a company outside of Amazon, Apple and Google developed this product, it will probably come with substantial benefits to the consumer. Stay tuned for more on this.
